/*** class: HStringView
  **
  ** HStringView is a view component that represents a non-editable line of text. 
  ** Commonly, stringview is used as a label to control elements 
  ** that do not have implicit labels (text fields, checkboxes and radio buttons, and menus). 
  ** Some form controls automatically have labels associated with them (press buttons) 
  ** while most do not have (text fields, checkboxes and radio buttons, and sliders etc.).  
  ** HStringView view or theme can be changed; the helmiTheme is used by default.
  **
  ** vars: Instance variables
  **  type - '[HStringView]'
  **  value - The string that this string view displays when drawn.
  **
  ** Extends:
  **  <HControl>
  **
  ** See also:
  **  <HControl>
  ***/
