    # Use the Servlet class to create responders for GET / POST urls.
    # 
    # A Servlet's public API is accessible like the other plugins directly.
    # 
    # == Responding to a URL consists of four phases:
    # 1. PluginManager calls every {Servlet__#match #match} method
    # 2. The plugins that return true to the {Servlet__#match #match} method are queried by their score -method
    # 3. The matched plugins are sorted by score, lowest score wins. If it's a draw between equal scores, the choice is randomized.
    # 4. The {Servlet__#post #post} or {Servlet__#get #get} method is called, depending on the type of HTTP request.
    #
    # = Extension hooks for server events
    # These methods are provided as the basic server event hooks:
    # * {#init +#init+} -- Use instead of +initialize+
    # * {#open +#open+} -- Extend to open objects
    # * {#flush +#flush+} -- Extend to write the state and to flush buffers
    # * {#close +#close+} -- Extend to close objects
    #
    # = Extension hooks for REST events
    # * {#match +#match+} -- Extend to return true for certain url and request_type conditions.
    # * {#score +#score+} -- Extend to return a numeric score. Lower scores are "better" than higher ones. 
    # * {#get   +#get+} -- Extend to handle a HTTP GET request and response.
    # * {#post  +#post+} -- Extend to handle a HTTP POST request and response.
